# Linear-Algebra-on-GPU
A simple project for learning to build CUDA kernel. I will implement and upload more functions. 

## Functions

1. Vector Addition
2. Matrix Addition
3. Dot Product
4. Element Wise Product
5. Scalar Multiplication
6. Matrix Multiplication
7. Matrix Vector Multiplication
8. Matrix Transpose

## Environment
NVIDIA GPU  
CUDA toolkit

## Execute
```bash
# Example command
nvcc transpose_coalesced.cu -o transpose_coalesced
./transpose_coalesced
```
